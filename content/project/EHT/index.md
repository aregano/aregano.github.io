I conducted this project during my PhD studies, where I construct a comprehensive dataset exclusively from Endothelial cells from the Aorta Gonad Mesonephros regiong of E10.5 mouse embryos.

Furthermore the dataset contains 5 experimental conditions with two controls, depending on the cell labeling strategy. Said conditions where conditional genetics aimed to understand the role of Notch signaling during Endothelial to Hematopoietic Transition (EHT).

Although the project's aim was to focus exclusively on EHT, even when using state-of-the-art genetic tools, modifying Notch signaling at either E8.0 or E9.5 can affect not only EHT, but also arterialization and overall embryo development.
