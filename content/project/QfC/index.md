title: Understanding the Tumor Microenvironment in various pediatric brain cancer tumors
summary:  Analyze many patient FFPE samples and focus on the immune compartment to better understand the immune response against those tumor types and find novel therapeutical targets against them.

This project is the main focus of my Postdoctoral period at the Princess Maxima Center and it comprises three different goals, based on the different grants that make it possible.

1. MIMIC - Myeloid cell targeting to enhance T-cell immunotherapy in pediatric high-grade brain cancers (pHGBT): This project aims at understanding the immune Tumor microenvironment (TME) of pHGBT (high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, ependymomas)  by mapping it using transcriptomic (FLEX scRNAseq, Xenium) and proteomic (MACSima, Flow cytometry) approaches, in  order to identify (dys)functional immune cells. The project will be focused on lymphocytes and suppressive myeloid cells and the cell-cell interactions they are involved so as to identify novel targets that may disrupt the suppressive TME in thiese cancers. 

2. EUROPE - Exploring Unknown Relapse Origins in Paediatric Ependymoma: The project aims to understand the spatial and temporal 

3. Quest for Cure:
