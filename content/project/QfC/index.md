In this project we investigate why the immune system struggles to combat Ependymoma tumours. Using advanced single-cell technologies, we will study ependymomas in detail to understand how they block immune responses. Based on this knowledge, we aim to design innovative treatments that enable immune cells to target and destroy the cancer cells that evade standard therapies.
