This project aims at understanding the immune Tumor microenvironment (TME) of pHGBT (high-grade gliomas, medulloblastomas, ependymomas)  by mapping it using transcriptomic (FLEX scRNAseq, Xenium) and proteomic (MACSima, Flow cytometry) approaches, in  order to identify (dys)functional immune cells. The project will be focused on lymphocytes and suppressive myeloid cells and the cell-cell interactions they are involved so as to identify novel targets that may disrupt the suppressive TME in thiese cancers.
