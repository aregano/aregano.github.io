During my PhD I worked on devising iFlpscLineage, a single cell lineage tracing (scLT) tool through RNA Barcoding that can be coupled with transcriptomic analysis and conditional genetics. iFlpscLineage can imporve biomedical research by allowing conditional genetics experiments, as other scLT tool, like DARLIN, Polylox and GESTALT, have proven to work couple with transcritpomical data. My role in the project concluded with the development of a workflow and initial testing of the tool for its future applications.
