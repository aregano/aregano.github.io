I spent close to a year volunteering in a small town next to Rome focused on making rural areas flourish, sustainable economy, rural tourism, summer camps and other various task related to bringing life back to rural areas. I managed a personal project called Magnalonga ad Anticoli Corrado, where I would design a trajectory across the town and nature, stopping at various spots to eat local food and explain various aspects of rural life and nature.
