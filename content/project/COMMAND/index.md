This project aims at generating models of Medulloblastoma by introducing tumour-causing mutations into cultured cells. With this approach we can study how and in which cells tumours are formed and test drugs. Here I focus on characterizing and assesing the similarity of these medulloblastoma models to the actual patient samples these models portray. For that I analyze snRNAseq data as well as DNA methylation array data to asses the similarity of these models with the real patient sample data.
