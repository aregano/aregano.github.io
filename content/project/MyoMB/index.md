Pediatric brain cancers are remarkably heterogeneous and new subcategories are being established in a constant manner. In the case of Medulloblastoma there are three main subtypes: WNT, SHH, G3/4. Yet a new subgroup has been described using DNA methylation array data, dubbed as G5/6. In this project I analyze FLEX scRNAseq data of patient samples belonging to that group in order to better characterize this new Medulloblastoma subtype.
