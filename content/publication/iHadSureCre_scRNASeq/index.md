abstract: "Methods for modifying gene function at high spatiotemporal resolution in mice have revolutionized biomedical research, with Cre-loxP being the most widely used technology. However, the Cre-loxP technology has several drawbacks, including weak activity, leakiness, toxicity, and low reliability of existing Cre-reporters. This is mainly because different genes flanked by loxP sites (floxed) vary widely in their sensitivity to Cre-mediated recombination. Here, we report the generation, validation, and utility of iSuRe-HadCre, a new dual Cre-reporter and deleter mouse line that avoids these drawbacks. iSuRe-HadCre achieves this through a novel inducible dual-recombinase genetic cascade that ensures that cells expressing a fluorescent reporter had only transient Cre activity, that is nonetheless sufficient to effectively delete floxed genes. iSuRe-HadCre worked reliably in all cell types and for the 13 floxed genes tested. This new tool will enable the precise, efficient, and trustworthy analysis of gene function in entire mouse tissues or in single cells."
